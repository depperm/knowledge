### Advice



It doesn't matter what language or what framework, just code something. Start small and do some [challenges ](challenges.md)but put some code down. Find a [github ](https://github.com/search?q=javascript\&type=repositories)project in the language of your choice, or find a project and learn a new language. Recreate your favorite website/game then add a missing feature, simplify it, change it, or create something completely new.



### Help

Bugs happen to everyone, more senior developers have just run into more bugs more frequently, so know how to fix/prevent them quicker (practice makes ~~perfect~~ close enough). Luckily generally bugs are both small and previously encountered.



* Compile Time Bug:
  * examine the output, 99% of the time not only will the line number be mentioned, but the column and reason for the error will be listed as well (make sure to start at the top of error output). Most languages error handling attempts to be human readable. Often you can figure out the issue and solution on your own. Try something before giving up. If you can't figure out a solution within 15 minutes, move onto asking for help below
* Unexpected/Wrong Output
  * add logs in your code to verify values at varying spots
  * use breakpoints and step through code with debugger (some IDEs have)
  * talk out loud and explain what each line should be doing, this will be 10x more effective if someone else watching/listening over your shoulder...pairwise programming
* Asking for help:
  * [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) has been a destination of programming questions and answers for years.
    * Google your problem first (with site:stackoverflow.com)
    * If you want to ask a question that people might answer: Describe the problem, include relevant code, input (if using), output, expected output, and anything else you've tried.
  * [grepper](https://www.grepper.com) has code snippets
  * ask a coworker/friend, if possible. Second pair of eyes is almost always a quick way to a solution
  * [chatgpt](https://www.chat.openai.com/) - explain your problem, any requirements (libraries, languages, input, etc), maybe your current code snippet
    * this will often be hit/miss. Its trained on input from the internet, some of the training data is wrong or irrelevant. This is a tool, and output should always be taken with a grain of salt
