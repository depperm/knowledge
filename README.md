### Advice



It doesn't matter what language or what framework, just code something. Start small and do some [challenges](challenges.md) but put some code down. Find a [github ](https://github.com/search?q=javascript\&type=repositories)project in the language of your choice, or find a project and pick another language. Recreate your favorite website/game, add a missing feature, simplify it, change it, or create something completely new.
